## Getting Started

Most repositories are **private** and accessible to ICT members and authorized collaborators. If you are an ICT researcher, request access through your project lead or contact the repository maintainer listed in each repo.

For **public repositories** (e.g., `ICT-Optimal-Mix-Design-Tool`), clone and follow the instructions in each repo's README:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ictuillinois/.git
cd 
# See repository-specific README for setup instructions
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from ICT researchers, UIUC affiliates, and external collaborators on public repositories. Please:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Follow existing code style and documentation conventions.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes.
4. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss scope and approach.

For private repositories, coordinate directly with the project PI or repository owner before contributing.
